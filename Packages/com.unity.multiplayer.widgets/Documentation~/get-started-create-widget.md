## Add a multiplayer widget to your scene

To create a multiplayer widget, perform the following actions:

1. Right-click anywhere in the **Hierarchy** window to open the Context menu.
2. Select **Multiplayer** > **Widgets**.
3. Select a widget to create.
4. Unity automatically creates the widget GameObject and its dependencies in the **Hierarchy** window and places it in your scene.
5. Enter **Play** mode to test the widget.

**Note**: To test multiplayer widgets that use sessions, [install the Multiplayer Play Mode package](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/mppm/current/install/) and [enable virtual players](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/mppm/current/virtual-players/virtual-players-enable/).
