# Control how Unity initializes a Multiplayer service

[!INCLUDE [banner-message](snippets/banner-message.md)]

When you enter Play Mode in a project that uses multiplayer widgets, Unity does the following by default:
* Initializes UnityServices.
* Initializes Vivox if it already exists in your project.
* Uses the anonymous sign-in to authenticate a user.

If your project uses another authentication method, or you want to initialize these features at another time, override the default initialization behavior. To do this:
* In the main menu, go to **Edit** > **Project Settings**.
* Select **Widgets**.
* Enable **Use Custom Service Initialization**.

When you enable this property, you need to manually initialize the following services for Widgets to work:

* [Unity Gaming Services (UGS)](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/manual/overview/manual/getting-started#InitializingUGS)
* [Authentication](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/authentication/manual/use-anon-sign-in)
* [Vivox Service](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/authentication/manual/use-anon-sign-in), when the Vivox Package exists in your Project.

When you enable **Use Custom Service Initialization** Unity creates a ScriptableObject in the Assets folder under **Assets** > **Multiplayer Widgets** > **Resources** > **MultiplayerWidgetsSettings**.
To tell multiplayer widgets that you have initialized one or more of these services, call `WidgetServiceInitialization.ServicesInitialized` in the **MultiplayerWidgetsSettings** script.
