For more information, refer to [INetworkHandler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.services.multiplayer@1.0/api/Unity.Services.Multiplayer.INetworkHandler.html) in the Multiplayer Services API for reference. To get started with Netcode for Entities and the multiplayer widgets, use the [Multiplayer Center's Quickstart tab](widgets-and-the-multiplayer-center.md). |
